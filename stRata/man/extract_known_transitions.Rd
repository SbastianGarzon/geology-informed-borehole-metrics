\title{Extract Known Transitions}
\usage{
extract_known_transitions(df_labeled)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_labeled}{A data frame containing borehole data with stratigraphic information.
The data frame should include at least two columns: \code{nr} (borehole identifier) and \code{strat_inter}
(the stratigraphic unit/formation).}
}
\value{
A vector containing the unique known transitions (boundary) between different stratigraphic units
that occur in the data.
}
\description{
This function extracts known transitions between stratigraphic units for each borehole.
A transition is defined as the change from one formation to the next along the borehole.
The function calculates these transitions, ensuring that boundaries between the same stratigraphic
unit are excluded from the final transition list.
