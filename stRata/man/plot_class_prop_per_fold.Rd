\title{Plot Class Proportions Across Folds}
\usage{
plot_class_prop_per_fold(df_labeled, stratigraphic_order, color_vector)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_labeled}{A data frame containing labeled data, including columns \code{fold} (fold number) and \code{strat_inter} (lithostratigraphic unit).}

\item{stratigraphic_order}{A character vector defining the desired order of stratigraphic units.}

\item{color_vector}{A named vector mapping lithostratigraphic units to specific colors.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object displaying the class proportions across folds.
}
\description{
This function generates a bar plot visualizing the proportion of lithostratigraphic units across different cross-validation folds.
It helps to assess the distribution of classes within each fold, ensuring a balanced stratification.
